I am firmly convinced that books have the power to transport you to different places, providing relaxation, calmness, wisdom, and even humour. I hold a strong belief that self-study is a path to self-development, and knowledge holds significant power. However, during my upbringing, it was uncommon to come across books authored by women who resembled me. The under-representation of women in the mainstream media and leadership roles inspired me to pursue studies in Journalism and Media. I have obtained a Bachelor\u2019s degree, in Journalism and Media from Birkbeck, University of London. I received first class for my dissertation, focused on women researchers in new technologies who are making an impact in our society.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My blog aims to foster connections, motivate, entertain and educate for social good. To those who have been part of this journey since its beginning, I express heartfelt gratitude for your care and support. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are just getting to know me, and to the newcomers, I hope you enjoy this journey as much as I do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that individuals of various age groups, have unique perspectives and life experiences that provide valuable opportunities for learning from each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that you enjoy your time here reading these pages!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s create wonderful memories together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dearly Victoria<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Greetings and Welcome I am Victoria, an individual who loves to share, collaborate and actively engage with others on topics I\u2019m passionate about.
