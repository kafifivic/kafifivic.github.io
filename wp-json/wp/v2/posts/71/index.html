For example, there is currently a diverse array of models of colour on the runways, a significant increase from when I initially entered the modelling profession. At the time, it appeared that only one or two spots were available for ethnic models on each runway. A notable shift is occurring, focusing on empowering the next generation of young Black women who were once disregarded but are now being acknowledged and told that they too matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1005\" height=\"640\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/victoriakafifi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/FB_IMG_1549809136426-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-66\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/victoriakafifi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/FB_IMG_1549809136426-1.jpg 1005w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/victoriakafifi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/FB_IMG_1549809136426-1-300x191.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/victoriakafifi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/FB_IMG_1549809136426-1-768x489.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/victoriakafifi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/FB_IMG_1549809136426-1-973x620.jpg 973w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/victoriakafifi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/FB_IMG_1549809136426-1-508x324.jpg 508w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1005px) 100vw, 1005px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Increased awareness about diversity and inclusion, especially regarding the representation of women of colour in the fashion industry, has been widely discussed in the mainstream media. However, it&#8217;s crucial to distinguish between desiring inclusion and advocating for a complete overhaul of the exclusive system. Despite the ongoing journey and the need for more efforts, it&#8217;s important to acknowledge and celebrate the positive changes achieved so far.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to those who paved the way, we can now observe firsthand the transformation taking place in the fashion world. It is a triumph that this transformation is underway, even though it is happening gradually. In the Autumn\/Winter 2019 shows, the visibility of the change and its progression seemed more significant, marking a notable shift in the fashion industry towards becoming a more naturally inclusive space, with promising prospects for the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prominent figures, such as Pierpaolo Piccioli, serve as excellent examples of the practical implications of this change. During the couture season in Paris, Piccioli demonstrated a commitment to diversity by predominantly casting black models for his magnificent, colourful, feminine, and stunning Valentino collection. This historic move empowered Black women to confidently embrace their beauty without reservation. The presentation was not just a passing trend but a significant statement and stance, asserting that black women have always been a powerful presence and continue to demonstrate their capability. The myth that women of colour cannot effectively influence and sell has been debunked, as evidenced by the recent elevation of models of colour as cover girls on Vogue magazine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"799\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/victoriakafifi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/IMG_0705.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-74\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/victoriakafifi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/IMG_0705.jpg 640w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/victoriakafifi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/IMG_0705-240x300.jpg 240w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/victoriakafifi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/IMG_0705-508x634.jpg 508w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Witnessing diverse women featured on the front cover, irrespective of their age, race, abilities, and ethnicity, proved to be genuinely inspiring. I take immense pride in the achievements at British Vogue, where the work underscored the significance of diversity and inclusion within the fashion industry. Appreciation goes to the distinguished Edward Enninful, the editor-in-chief for British Vogue, He truly exemplifies legendary status.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe and agree that beauty is diverse, and the fashion industry must acknowledge the influence of showcasing a broader spectrum of beauty. It should serve as a platform for diversity that promotes inclusivity in an exclusive manner. Representation in media and other services is crucial for everyone to see themselves. Brands should also cater to a wide demographic range because when people witness diversity in high fashion modelling, it becomes easier for them to relate to the collections.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a society, we have made significant strides to adapt to changes, embrace diversity, and appreciate individual uniqueness.
