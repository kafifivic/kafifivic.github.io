<p>This season, designers in New York, London, and Milan have subverted industry norms by casting models of various ages in their shows. In regards  to age, body size and race, there was a diverse representation on the runway at the Johnston of Elgin fashion show. One lesson this season taught us is that, it is evident that age is merely a number, one to which the fashion industry should no longer conform. </p>



<p></p>



<p>While seasons and influences may change, one constant remains: the quest for beauty and elegance. Johnstons of Elgin creates desirable pieces of art designed to resonate with its customers, precious objects of real beauty that hold great personal meaning in today’s disposable culture.According to Scott, Johnstons of Elign has retained its reputation for quality, artistry,innovation and designs for over two centuries.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">These pillars are the very heart of what they do on a day to day basis and are demonstrated year after year. The Autumn Winter 19 collection exemplifies the brand’s exceptional craftsmanship,including intarsia hand-knitting and 360 digital printing technology.  Johnstons of Elign collection reflects the keen sense of style and understanding of diverse tastes.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Flashes of tartan give a nod to the brand’s proud Scottish heritage, which dates right back to 1797.This sophisticated,elegant and colourful collection proves that Johnstons of Elgin is master of textile innovation and a brand for all seasons. In conclusion, this sophisticated and elegant fashion truly captivated, seamlessly embracing all ages with a timeless and inclusive allure.</p>

<p><em>One of the most thrilling moment of my career was meeting her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Her Majesty the Queen made an astonishing surprise appearance at London Fashio</em>n week. She was accompanied by Caroline Rush, the Chief Executive of the British Fashion Council, who guided her through the venue, observing presentations of various designers&#8217; collections during London Fashion Week. Her Majesty took the time to visit each designer, engaging in conversations. Her purpose for attending London Fashion Week was to bestow the inaugural Queen Elizabeth 2 Award for British design.</p>
