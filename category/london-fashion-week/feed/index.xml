<p>During London Fashion Week, I had the privilege of meeting renowned designers, and one who particularly made an epic return this season was Julien Macdonald. An internationally acclaimed British fashion designer, Julien Macdonald OBE, pursued fashion knitwear at the University of Brighton and earned his MA at the Royal College of Art in London. This award-winning designer has adorned celebrities such as Mariah Carey, Beyoncé, Naomi Campbell, Rihanna, and more. Julien Macdonald&#8217;s latest collection, titled &#8220;Julien x Gabriela,&#8221; is a collaboration with socialite Gabriela Gonzalez.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="640" height="798" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_8839.png" alt="Julien Macdonald OBE Celebrates Authentic Beauty" class="wp-image-116" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_8839.png 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_8839-241x300.png 241w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_8839-508x633.png 508w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Julien Macdonald OBE Celebrates Authentic Beauty</figcaption></figure>



<p>This season&#8217;s event unfolded as a star-studded fashion spectacle. Izabel Goulart, a former Victoria&#8217;s Secret model, kicked off the show, and the other models showcased dazzling knit gowns, jumpsuits, and swimwear adorned with sparkling sequins and knit mesh. The essence of this new collection is to commemorate womanhood, embracing diversity, and celebrating a variety of body shapes and sizes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="777" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_8966.jpg" alt="Julien Macdonald OBE Celebrates Authentic Beauty" class="wp-image-112" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_8966.jpg 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_8966-247x300.jpg 247w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_8966-508x617.jpg 508w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Julien Macdonald OBE Celebrates Authentic Beauty</figcaption></figure>



<p><br>The British Fashion Council has been promoting awareness of Positive Fashion. Julien Macdonald is dedicated to sustainable fashion practices, incorporating organic fabrics and maintaining environmental consciousness. He also want a better representation of diverse woman on the Catwalk.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="799" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/34AE9546-17ED-43EB-8CBB-92105558C619.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-114" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/34AE9546-17ED-43EB-8CBB-92105558C619.jpg 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/01/34AE9546-17ED-43EB-8CBB-92105558C619-240x300.jpg 240w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/01/34AE9546-17ED-43EB-8CBB-92105558C619-508x634.jpg 508w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Myself with Model Emilia boateng</figcaption></figure>



<p>The British Fashion Council (BFC), recognises that the fashion industry engages consumers daily. Therefore, through the Institute of Positive Fashion (IPF), their aim is to create an industry blueprint by bringing together expertise from different areas to help brands with a platform designed to celebrate industry best practice and encourage future business decisions to create positive change.</p>

<p></p>



<p>This season, designers in New York, London, and Milan have subverted industry norms by casting models of various ages in their shows. In regards  to age, body size and race, there was a diverse representation on the runway at the Johnston of Elgin fashion show. One lesson this season taught us is that, it is evident that age is merely a number, one to which the fashion industry should no longer conform. </p>



<p></p>



<p>While seasons and influences may change, one constant remains: the quest for beauty and elegance. Johnstons of Elgin creates desirable pieces of art designed to resonate with its customers, precious objects of real beauty that hold great personal meaning in today’s disposable culture.According to Scott, Johnstons of Elign has retained its reputation for quality, artistry,innovation and designs for over two centuries.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">These pillars are the very heart of what they do on a day to day basis and are demonstrated year after year. The Autumn Winter 19 collection exemplifies the brand’s exceptional craftsmanship,including intarsia hand-knitting and 360 digital printing technology.  Johnstons of Elign collection reflects the keen sense of style and understanding of diverse tastes.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Flashes of tartan give a nod to the brand’s proud Scottish heritage, which dates right back to 1797.This sophisticated,elegant and colourful collection proves that Johnstons of Elgin is master of textile innovation and a brand for all seasons. In conclusion, this sophisticated and elegant fashion truly captivated, seamlessly embracing all ages with a timeless and inclusive allure.</p>
